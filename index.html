    <h2>About Emma_GIS</h2>
    <p>
        EMMA_GIS Geospatial Services is a Nigerian-based geospatial consulting firm providing data-driven location intelligence and spatial solutions that support smarter decision-making for governments, institutions, and organizations.
We specialize in transforming complex spatial data into clear maps, interactive dashboards, and actionable insights that help decision-makers understand problems, plan effectively, and deliver sustainable outcomes. Our work sits at the intersection of GIS, remote sensing, data visualization, and emerging AI-powered spatial analysis.
Founded to bridge the gap between data and impact, EMMA_GIS supports projects in urban planning, housing and land administration, infrastructure development, environmental management, agriculture, and disaster risk management.

<p>
    What We Do
At EMMA_GIS, we deliver end-to-end geospatial solutions, including:

•	Thematic and policy-oriented mapping
•	Interactive web maps, dashboards, and story maps
•	GIS support for housing, land governance, and infrastructure projects
•	Custom geospatial applications and decision-support tools
Our solutions are designed to be practical, visual, and decision-ready, ensuring our clients can move from insight to action with confidence.

<p>
    Our Impact
We have contributed to and executed impactful geospatial projects across Nigeria, including:
•	Accident Hotspot Mapping in AMAC, FCT, integrating land-use, infrastructure, and topology datasets to improve urban safety and planning.
•	GIS-Enabled State Mapping for the Federal Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, now used within the Ministry to support data-driven housing and land policy formulation.
•	Environmental and infrastructure mapping initiatives, supporting development monitoring, resilience planning, and spatial transparency.
